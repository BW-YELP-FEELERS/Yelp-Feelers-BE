It'll cost you. Over $100 for two without drinks during happy hour. Gulp. \n\nRegardless, everything we had was delicious, and we had just about everything. A few minor notes: the wasabi aioli overwhelmed the fish lettuce wraps and the taro chips with tuna and salmon were a bit salty.  I did not care for the mango cheesecake, mostly the texture. \n\nThe miso black cod was stunning! The sizzling shrimp with caramelization onions, asparagus and enoki mushrooms in a sweet sauce was delectable and a value at $14 for 6 plump shrimp. The beef on everything from the skewers to tacos was tender and flavorful. We really enjoyed the gyoza; they were so beefy and interesting. Such a departure from the average light filling. This was like biting into a cheeseburger gyoza. Yum. The bone marrow was tasty but we agreed you need 4 people to share the decadent dish. Too much for 2. \n\nThe Chef visited our table twice. We had great and knowledgeable service. I would certainly go again. There was much more to try. The experience will be better with drinks when they come."},

Just don't. Fish tacos were abysmal; the battered fish was soggy and there was zero crunch, flavour or redemption. Salsa with quesadillas tasted like it came out of a bottle from 1989. Band was too loud for the venue. Maybe come for a drink if you like jazz, but there are way better places on Roncy. My belly still aches from the food. Plastic folio menus were a good indicator of quality."},

Keep an eye out of mahi mahi fish tacos, Coffee and Cigarettes cupcakes, and a local cigar group on Friday nights.\n\nOther notes: Beware laptop users, limited power outlets; Vespa\\\/scooter owners, there's a reserved parking spot for you; Produce stand (seasonal) is across the way"},

We stumbled in here after looking for nearby food and couldn't resist the name.\n\nThey have a wide beer selection from breweries all over on draft with a supplemental bottled list that is sure to hit anyone's tastes or prefences.\n\nThey have a full bar so if beer isn't your thing,  no worries. \n\nThat leads us to the tacos, there is such a variety of different amazing tacos that we found ourselves hard pressed not to order way too many. \n\nRather then having plates the tacos are are alacart. The al pastor taco was my favorite, but nothing we tried was short of a 4 to 5 star taco.\n\nIf you havent tried this place you have to get in here!! The service was amazing, Emily was so sweet and attentive helping us navigate through the many tacos.\n\nWill be bringing our friends here!!"},

However, the quality of almost everything was wonderful. The menu recommends that you order 4 snacks and 2 mains. I could have swam in a bucket of the gorgeous Ismali Beef Curry.\n\nThis dish is beyond the scope of any curry you've had in Toronto, and like nothing that you will have anywhere. The chef explained that it's her great grandmother's recipe and very special to her. If I had a family recipe like this, I'd be just as proud. It's a silky mixture of peanut, coconut... and EGADS...what else is in there??? The server said there were over 27?? ingredients and it takes a week to make. This spicy, harmonious curry clung to the sous vide beef and soft potatoes like a velvet glove. This dish was probably one of the best things I've eaten in my life.\n\nThe Kho Say was delicious, too. Crunchy noodles, soft noodles, a light creeping spice and a fabulous coconut broth.\n\nChicken paratha tacos were amazingly delicious, and full of flavour. Really liked the paratha shell, too.\n\nCauliflower was a wonderful side with our curries and a must have with any of the dishes.\n\nThe ceviche was okay. I found the portion to be a little smaller than almost everything else we ate and the fish felt a little buried under the rice puffs.\n\nMilk pastry was out of this world! \n\nBottles of wine are the way to go as the pours by the glass are only about 4 oz. Bottles are all below $40 and chosen to highlight the depth of flavours in the food. Not always easy to pair, but they've made some good choices.\n\nI love that we live so close to this place and I'm already planning to return next Friday with some friends. Rickshaw bar is a favourite new place!"}
